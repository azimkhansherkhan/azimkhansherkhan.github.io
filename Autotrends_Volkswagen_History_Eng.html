<h1>HISTORY OF VOLKSWAGEN</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: PT Sans, sans-serif; line-height: 25px; color: #222222">On May 26, 1938, the construction of a new plant began in Wolfsburg. Before the war began in 1939, only a few cars were assembled. With the outbreak of hostilities, production was redesigned for the production of military vehicles, such as the Kübelwagen (“car-pelvis”). He received an open four-door body with flat panels, a rear wheel gearbox, an interwheel limited-slip differential, an independent suspension of all wheels, a clearance of 290 mm and 16-inch wheels. Since March 1943, it was equipped with a 25-horsepower engine with a capacity of 1130 cm3. The air-cooled engine worked stably in all climates. The car was not afraid of bullets due to the lack of a radiator. The maximum speed was 80 km/h.
After the war, the company's factories were badly damaged by bombing and fell into the British occupation zone. They organized repair and maintenance of military equipment at the remaining capacities. The enterprise had to be destroyed, since it was engaged in the production of military products and used slave labor. However, one of the officers of the British army drew a civilian vehicle manufactured at the enterprise and showed it at the headquarters of the English army. Thanks to this, the British government placed an order for 20,000 cars, and assembly began.

By 1946, the plant was producing 1,000 cars a month, which was an excellent achievement, given that it was still in disrepair. The fate of the plant remained unclear for a long time. In 1948, Volkswagen became a symbol of the restoration of Germany. Its lineup has been replenished with a Volkswagen Type 2 commercial vehicle with an 1100 cc air-cooled engine mounted in the rear. In 1965, the brand released a version with a load capacity of 1000 kg instead of 750 kg, and then replaced the 1.2-liter engine with a 1.5-liter. Volkswagen introduced a new type of vehicle in the 1960s. They used a monocoque body, an optional automatic transmission, an electronic fuel injection system and powerful power plants. In 1971, the brand introduced the Super Beetle, which differs from the standard model using the MacPherson strut instead of the conventional torsion bar. 2-liter 1.5-liter engine.
